### Creating some text with nice Font

`https://www.dafont.com/`
+ Imported `Funky Junk` Font
+ Added text
+ Added sounds
+ Duplicated to create a start scene
+ StartGame and quit made into buttons
+ Created script for scene management
+ Create a coroutine within the script to add int delay
+ Added within build setting our current two scenes
+ created prefabs for safety

Ran into an annoying issue where unity kept overwriting my scenes
