+ After you have created your Animation Object and tested it. To connect one animation from `Right click in the Animator > Make Transition`
+ May need to redo Lizard walk to that it also has a spreadsheet thats sliced by `grid by cell size`

+ Be sure to make any adjustments to make sure it loops and is at the proper speed
+ No need to blend animations in 2D
